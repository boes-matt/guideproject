# Guide Project

Guide Project is an experiment in building a better Android app.

I use interfaces, a dependency injection pattern, and follow a test-driven development approach.

I use Espresso and Mockito in tests.

I move all business logic outside of Android system into pure Java library.

The data for the app is mocked, and there is only one guide in the mocked data set.
